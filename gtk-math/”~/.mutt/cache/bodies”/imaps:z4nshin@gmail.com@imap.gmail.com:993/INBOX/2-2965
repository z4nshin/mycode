Thank you for registering for the Nokia Email beta. This message contains important information about the service and how to use it.

Do I have to pay for the Nokia Email service?

During the beta, you do not pay to use the Nokia Email service, which sends your email from your email address to your Nokia mobile phone.

By sending email to your phone, you will be using your operator network to send data over the air. Normal data transfer charges will apply. For more information, check your operator data plan agreement.

What happens after the beta?

When the beta ends, we will notify you by email with instructions about how to continue Nokia Email service. If you decide not to continue the service, your beta account will end automatically. You will not have to do anything.

What should I do if I have not received the text message that I need to install this email service on my phone?

To send another text message (SMS) with a Nokia Email download link to your phone or to a different Nokia phone, just return to the Web site (https://netac6.vie.hosting.nokia.com/account) , log in to your account, and click Install now. A new message is sent.
