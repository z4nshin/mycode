<h1>pyrepl</h1>

<p>
For ages now, I've been working on and off on a replacement for
readline for use from Python.  readline is undoubtedly great, but a
couple of things irritate me about it.  One is the inability to do
sane multi-line editing.  Have you ever typed something like:
</p>
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(10):
...     for i in range(10):
...         print i*j
</pre>
<p>
into a Python top-level?  Grr, that "i" on the second line should have
been a "j".  Wouldn't it be nice if you could just press "up" on your
keyboard and fix it?  This was one of the aims I kept in mind when
writing pyrepl (or pyrl as I used to call it, but that name's <a
href="http://www.algonet.se/~jsjogren/oscar/cython/">taken</a>).
</p>
<p>
Another irritation of readline is the GPL.  I'm not even nearly as
anti-GPL as some, but I don't want to have to GPL my program just so I
can use readline.
</p>
<p>
0.7 adds to the version that runs an a terminal an experimental
version that runs in a pygame surface.  A long term goal is
Mathematica-like notebooks, but that's a loong way off...
</p>
<p>
Anyway, after many months of intermittent toil I present:
</p>
<p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center">
<a href="pyrepl-0.7.2.tar.gz">pyrepl 0.7.2</a>
</p>
<p style="font-size: smaller; text-align: center">
(0.7.2 fixes a number of silly small typos and slips)
</p>
<p style="font-size: smaller; text-align: center">
(the significant change since 0.7 is inclusion of a working setup.py...)
</p>
<p>
<p style="text-align: center">
For more details on the changes since 0.6, you can read the <a href="pyrepl-CHANGES">CHANGES</a> file.
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold">NEWS</span> (as of Dec 12 2002):
pyrepl now has dedicated <a
href="http://pyrepl.codespeak.net/mailman/listinfo/">mailing lists</a>
where discussion about pyrepl's development will take place.
</p>
<p>
Dependencies: Python 2.1 with the termios and curses modules built (I
don't really use curses, but I need the terminfo functions that live
in the curses module), or pygame installed (if you want to live on the
bleeding edge).
</p>
<p>
There are probably portability gremlins in some of the ioctl using
code.  Fixes gratefully received!
</p>
<p>
Features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
sane multi-line editing
</li>
<li>
history, with incremental search
</li>
<li>
completion, including displaying of available options
</li>
<li>
a fairly large subset of the readline emacs-mode key bindings (adding
more is mostly just a matter of typing)
</li>
<li>
Deliberately liberal, Python-style license
</li>
<li>
a new python top-level that I really like; possibly my favourite
feature I've yet added is the ability to type
<pre>
-&gt;&gt; from __f
</pre>
and hit TAB to get
<pre>
-&gt;&gt; from __future__
</pre>
then you type " import n" and hit tab again to get:
<pre>
-&gt;&gt; from __future__ import nested_scopes
</pre>
(this is very addictive!).
</li>
<li>
no global variables, so you can run two independent
readers without having their histories interfering.
</li>
<li>
An experimental version that runs in a pygame surface.
</li>x
</ul>
<p>
pyrepl currently consists of four major classes:
</p>
<pre>
Reader &lt;- HistoricalReader &lt;- CompletingReader &lt;- PythonReader
</pre>
<p>
There's also a <tt>UnixConsole</tt> class that handles the low-level
details.
</p>
<p>
Each of these lives in it's own file, and there are a bunch of support
files (including a C module that just provides a bit of a speed up -
building it is strictly optional).
</p>
<p>
IMHO, the best way to get a feel for how it works is to type
</p>
<pre>
$ python pythoni
</pre>
<p>
and just play around.  If you're used to readline's emacs-mode, you
should feel right at home.  One point that might confuse: because the
arrow keys are used to move up and down in the command currently being
edited, you need to use ^P and ^N to move through the history.
