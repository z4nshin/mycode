Description: pyrepl is a Python library, inspired by readline, for building flexible
        command line interfaces, featuring:
        * sane multi-line editing
        * history, with incremental search
        * completion, including displaying of available options
        * a fairly large subset of the readline emacs-mode keybindings
        * a liberal, Python-style, license
        * a new python top-level.
